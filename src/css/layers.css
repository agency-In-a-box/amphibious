/**
 * CSS Layer Architecture for Amphibious 2.0
 *
 * Layers are evaluated in the order they're defined.
 * Later layers override earlier ones without needing !important.
 *
 * Layer Hierarchy:
 * 1. reset     - Normalize and resets (lowest priority)
 * 2. tokens    - Design tokens and CSS variables
 * 3. base      - Base element styles
 * 4. layout    - Grid and layout systems
 * 5. components - Component styles (atoms, molecules, organisms)
 * 6. themes    - Theme variations
 * 7. utilities  - Utility classes (highest priority)
 */

/* Define layer order explicitly */
@layer reset, tokens, base, layout, components, themes, utilities;

/*
 * Browser Support Note:
 * @layer is supported in all modern browsers (2022+)
 * For older browsers, the cascade will still work,
 * just without the layer-based prioritization.
